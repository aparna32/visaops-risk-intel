# VisaOps Risk Intelligence System (VORIS)

A regime-aware early-warning and risk attribution framework for high-volume visa processing operations.

This project focuses on identifying weak operational signals, detecting regime shifts in service systems, and producing interpretable risk intelligence **before** visible SLA breakdowns occur.

The system is designed as a decision-support tool for regulated, queue-driven operations such as visa processing, KYC workflows, claims processing, and administrative healthcare systems.

## Core Components

- **Signal Engineering**  
  Rolling volatility, queue dynamics, utilization, escalation pressure, and SLA risk proxies.

- **Regime Detection** *(in progress)*  
  Identification of operational states (stable, congested, stressed) using statistical regime models.

- **Risk Scoring & Attribution** *(planned)*  
  Regime-conditioned risk estimation with interpretable driver attribution.

## Project Status

Current stage: **Signal layer implemented with synthetic operational data**  
Next stage: **Operational regime detection**

## Data Disclaimer

All data used in this repository is **synthetically generated** and does **not** contain proprietary, confidential, or real visa applicant information.

The synthetic dataset is constructed to reflect realistic operational dynamics for research and demonstration purposes only.
